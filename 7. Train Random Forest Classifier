<p>There's always the possibility of other models that will perform even better! Sometimes simplest is best, and so we will start by applying <b>logistic regression</b>.</p>

```python
#import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

train_features, test_features, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(pca_projection, labels, random_state=10)

tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=10)
tree.fit(train_features, train_labels)

pred_labels_tree = tree.predict(test_features)
print("Decision Tree: \n", class_rep_tree)
print("Logistic Regression: \n", class_rep_log)
```
